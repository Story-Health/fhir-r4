# TypeScript Type Definitions for FHIR R4

This package contains TypeScript types for [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/index.html).

All definitions have been forked from [Ahryman40k/typescript-fhir-types](https://github.com/Ahryman40k/typescript-fhir-types).

RTTI based runtime checks have been removed from the original library to reduce frontend bundle sizes. If you need runtime validation, please consider using the [original library](https://github.com/Ahryman40k/typescript-fhir-types).

## Installation

npm i --save @story-health/fhir-r4
